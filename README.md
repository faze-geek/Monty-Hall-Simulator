# Monty Hall Problem Simulator

The task is to develop a C++ (or Python) program that simulates the Monty Hall Problem, allowing for the simulation of scenarios with a variable number of doors and different strategies for opening doors by the host.

**I have implemented the simulator in C++ and Python, as I am comfortable in working with both**.
